# Cybersecurity Portfolio — Rostislav Ciorbu

This is a curated index of practical security projects demonstrating SOC analyst thinking, detection work, and operational security controls.  
I focus on alert triage, log analysis, incident investigation, and practical remediation.

**Quick jump:**  
- **SOC Alert Triage (Splunk)** — https://github.com/RCiorbu/SOC-Alert-Triage-Investigation  
  *Simulated brute-force → suspected compromise: logs, SPL queries, saved detection, triage ticket, and closeout.*

- **Security Log Analysis (SQL)** — https://github.com/RCiorbu/Security-Log-Analysis-SQL  
  *Query-driven log investigations showing how to isolate suspicious auth and system events using SQL.*

- **Incident Response Report** — https://github.com/RCiorbu/Incident-Response-Report  
  *Documented incident investigations and response workflow (timelines, evidence, lessons learned).*

- **Vulnerability Assessment Report** — https://github.com/RCiorbu/Vulnerability-Assessment-Report  
  *Structured vulnerability findings and clear remediation recommendations.*

- **Linux Permission Hardening** — https://github.com/RCiorbu/Linux-Permission-Hardening  
  *Privilege/permission audit and hardening steps for Linux hosts.*

- **Security Automation (Python)** — https://github.com/RCiorbu/Security-Automation-Access-Control  
  *Small scripts that automate file/allow-list maintenance for better auditability.*

### How to review (for hiring managers)
1. Read the short one-line summary above.  
2. Open the SOC Alert Triage repo (Splunk project) — it demonstrates Tier-1 workflow end-to-end.  
3. Check the Incident Response and SQL analysis repos for other analyst skills.
